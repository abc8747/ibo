This repository contains the code used to calculate the time-occupancy of traffic flow, which was used in my International Baccalaureate Geography Extended Essay (May 2022 examinations). The main repository can be found [here](https://github.com/abc8747/ibo) and the paper can be found [here](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6814244).

Check out the interface [here](https://abc8747.github.io/ibo/projects/occupancy-logger/), which outputs raw touch data (keydown, keyup) into a JSON file.
